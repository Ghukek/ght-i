The GHT Study Tool is a single-page web application serving Garth's Hyper-literal Translation with interlinear, advance search, parallel translations. 

[Garth's Hyper-literal Translation](https://www.wiebefamily.org/GHT.htm) is a new (2025) translation pushing the boundaries of "literal, word for word" further than ever before in English. Where other translations compromise for readability and consider interpretation to be a part of the translation process, the GHT minmizes interpretation as much as it can manage, resulting in a particularly challenging reading experience. Read the introduction on the source page for more details.

The GHT Study Tool focuses on enabling users to perform advanced grammatical and lexical searches based on the hypothesis that the most effective way to determine the meaning of any word or grammatical construction in a text is to review how that word or grammatical construction is used in various contexts. For more information on this mindset, refer to [this article](https://www.wiebefamily.org/Greek.htm). 

File structure: ght-i.html is a single-page document combined from ght-i-raw.html, styles.css, script.js, base.json, and lookups.json using buildghti.py. Several other supporting documents such as the extended json files, alternate translation jsons, images, and so on are not required for the core site functions.
